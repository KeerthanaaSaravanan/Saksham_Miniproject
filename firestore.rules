/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Saksham application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for private user data while allowing controlled access to shared learning resources. It prioritizes authorization independence through denormalization and ensures relational integrity through hierarchical data organization.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user profile data, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /learning_modules/{learningModuleId}: Stores learning modules.
 * - /exams/{examId}: Stores exam information.
 * - /exams/{examId}/questions/{questionId}: Stores questions for each exam.
 * - /users/{userId}/exam_attempts/{studentExamAttemptId}: Stores student exam attempts, nested under the user's document.
 * - /users/{userId}/exam_attempts/{studentExamAttemptId}/answers/{studentAnswerId}: Stores student answers, nested under the exam attempt.
 * - /users/{userId}/accessibility_profile/{accessibilityProfileId}: Stores user accessibility profiles.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is strictly controlled by the user's Firebase UID, ensuring that users can only access their own data.
 * - Listing of users is disallowed to prevent unauthorized data access.
 * - Data denormalization (e.g., including gradeLevel in LearningModule and Exam) enables efficient and secure list operations.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - StudentExamAttempt includes userId and examId to avoid get() calls.
 * - StudentAnswer includes studentExamAttemptId and questionId to avoid get() calls.
 * - LearningModule and Exam store gradeLevel to enable secure list operations based on user grade level.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User profiles are stored separately from learning modules and exams to ensure data isolation and access control.
