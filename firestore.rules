/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the Saksham application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for private user data and allows public read access to learning modules and exams.
 * Data integrity is maintained by enforcing immutability of key relational fields.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user profile data, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /learning_modules/{learningModuleId}: Stores publicly accessible learning modules.
 * - /exams/{examId}: Stores publicly accessible exam information.
 * - /exams/{examId}/questions/{questionId}: Stores questions associated with a specific exam.
 * - /users/{userId}/exam_attempts/{studentExamAttemptId}: Stores a user's attempts at an exam, accessible only by the owning user.
 * - /users/{userId}/exam_attempts/{studentExamAttemptId}/answers/{studentAnswerId}: Stores a user's answers to exam questions, accessible only by the owning user.
 * - /users/{userId}/accessibility_profile/{accessibilityProfileId}: Stores a user's accessibility profile, accessible only by the owning user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Public read access is granted for learning modules and exams.
 * - All write operations require authentication and authorization checks.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - StudentExamAttempt documents include userId and examId to avoid needing to fetch the User or Exam document for authorization.
 * - LearningModule and Exam documents include gradeLevel to enable secure list operations based on the user's grade level without requiring client-side filtering.
