/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the Saksham application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for private user data and allows public read access to learning modules and exams.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Learning modules are stored in a top-level `/learning_modules/{learningModuleId}` collection.
 * - Exams are stored in a top-level `/exams/{examId}` collection.
 * - Student exam attempts are stored under `/users/{userId}/exam_attempts/{studentExamAttemptId}`.
 * - Student answers are stored under `/users/{userId}/exam_attempts/{studentExamAttemptId}/answers/{studentAnswerId}`.
 * - Accessibility profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}/accessibility_profile/{accessibilityProfileId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read/write their own profile data.
 * - Learning modules and exams are publicly readable.
 * - Student exam attempts and answers are only accessible by the owning user.
 * - Listing of user documents is disallowed to prevent data leakage.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `StudentExamAttempt` entity includes `userId` and `examId` to avoid extra reads during authorization.
 * - The `StudentAnswer` entity includes `studentExamAttemptId` and `questionId` to avoid extra reads during authorization.
