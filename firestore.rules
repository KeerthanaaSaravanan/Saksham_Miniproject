/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for the Saksham application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for private user data and allows public read access to learning modules and exams while restricting writes to authorized users. Hierarchical data relationships are secured by path-based ownership checks and data denormalization.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user profile data, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /learning_modules/{learningModuleId}: Stores learning modules, publicly readable but write-protected.
 * - /exams/{examId}: Stores exam information, publicly readable but write-protected.
 * - /exams/{examId}/questions/{questionId}: Stores questions for exams, accessible only via their parent exam.
 * - /users/{userId}/exam_attempts/{studentExamAttemptId}: Stores student exam attempts, accessible only to the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/exam_attempts/{studentExamAttemptId}/answers/{studentAnswerId}: Stores student answers, accessible only via their parent attempt.
 * - /users/{userId}/accessibility_profile/{accessibilityProfileId}: Stores user's accessibility profiles, accessible only to the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Public read access is granted for learning modules and exams to facilitate open access to educational content.
 * - All write operations are strictly controlled via ownership checks to prevent unauthorized data modification.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - StudentExamAttempt documents contain the userId and examId, enabling direct authorization checks without additional `get()` calls.
